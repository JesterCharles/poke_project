<h1>Welcome to the Pokedex</h1>
<p>This is a project to be able to enter in new pokemon and view information on them for trainers. This is similar to a pokedex for trainers to allow them the ability to log in a register new pokemon. This project is current working as a backend only, the front end will be included in another repo at a later date.</p>

<input type="checkbox" id="user1" name="user1">
<label for="user1"> As a new trainer, I should be able to register myself on the system, so that I can begin using the poke project application.</label><br>
<input type="checkbox" id="user2" name="user2">
<label for="user2"> As a trainer, I should be able to log in once I've registered so that I can access the information in the database about all the known pokemon.</label><br>
<input type="checkbox" id="user3" name="user3">
<label for="user3"> As a trainer, I should be able to view all other trainers, so that I can contact any other trainers to maybe form a party.</label><br>
<input type="checkbox" id="user4" name="user4">
<label for="user4"> As a trainer I should be able to view all register pokemon, so that I can gain insight into all the pokemon's attributes I may one day own or face in a pokemon fight.</label><br>
<input type="checkbox" id="user5" name="user5">
<label for="user5"> As a trainer, I should be able to register a new pokemon into the database so that I can share this information with other trainers in the system.</label><br>
<input type="checkbox" id="user6" name="user6">
<label for="user6"> As a trainer, I should be able to update any information for a pokemon, so that I can help ensure the most accurate pokedex possible.</label><br>
